### Summarize Your IV and DV

At this point, you should have a data source that measures your main cause (IV) and your outcome (DV). Summarize the distributions of both variables, in ways that make sense given whether they are categorical or continuous. Are there any interesting details?

### Jointly Plot Your IV and DV

Plot your two main variables together in a way that shows as much information about their relationship as possible. Describe what you can see and what that means for your thinking about your research question.

### Bivariate Relationship

Carry out a statistical analysis of the bivariate relationship between your IV and your DV, using an appropriate significance test or regression. Explain the results and clarify their substantive meaning with respect to your research question.

### Initial Findings

Based on the initial data exploration in this lab, what are your initial findings about your main research question?
