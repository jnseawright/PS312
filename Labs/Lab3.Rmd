### Choose a Causal Inference Strategy

From the research designs we've discussed, choose a strategy for causal inference. Describe your choice and explain why this is a good fit for your problem. Does your existing data set contain what you need for this strategy? If not, search for other data that will provide what you need.

### Jointly Plot Your IV and DV

Plot your two main variables together in a way that shows as much information about their relationship as possible. Describe what you can see and what that means for your thinking about your research question.
