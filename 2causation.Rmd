### Potential Outcomes

-   Let's build a model of one person participating in the experiment.

---
### Potential Outcomes

-   Suppose we name that person $i$.

-   The person we're interested in says not extreme when in the control
    group, and extreme when in the treatment group.

---
### Potential Outcomes

-   $y_{i,c} = 0$

-   $y_{i,t} = 1$

---
### The Potential Outcomes Framework

-   We are interested in the effects of a dichotomous treatment (i.e.,
    independent variable): whether person got the treatment (t) or the
    control (c).

-   This variable can be written as $W_{i} = (t,c)$.

---
### The Potential Outcomes Framework

-   For a given case, $i$, we either observe $W_{i} = t$ or $W_{i} = c$.
    If $W_{i} = t$, let us denote the value of the dependent variable as
    $y_{i,t}$. If $W_{i} = c$, let us denote the value of the dependent
    variable as $y_{i,c}$

---
### The Potential Outcomes Framework

-   The causal effect of $W$ on $y$ is:

    -   $y_{i,t} - y_{i,c}$

---
### The Average Treatment Effect

-   Sometimes, we are interested in developing an estimate of the effect
    of $W$ on $y$ in some population $\Pi$, from which we have a random
    sample (or even the whole population) split randomly into treatment
    and control cases.

-   Here, interest focuses on the "average treatment effect":

    -   $E(y_{i,t}) - E(y_{i,c})$

---
### Experiments and Causal Inference

-   When our treatment is randomly assigned, the set of cases where
    $W_{i} = t$ produces a random sample from the population of $y_{t}$.
    Likewise, the set of cases where $W_{i} = c$ produces a random
    sample from the population of $y_{c}$. Thus:

    -   $E_{t}(y_{i,t}) = E(y_{i,t})$

    -   $E_{c}(y_{i,c}) = E(y_{i,c})$

    -   $E(y_{i,t}) - E(y_{i,c}) = E_{t}(y_{i,t}) - E_{c}(y_{i,c})$

---
### The Four Questions

1.  Is there a relationship between $X$ and $Y$?

2.  Could $Y$ cause $X$?

3.  Is there a pathway linking $X$ and $Y$?

4.  Are there *confounding variables*?

---
### Controlling for Confounders

**Controlling for a confounder** is choosing a set of cases that all
have the same score on the confounding variable and looking at the
relationship between the IV and the DV in only those cases.

---
### Problems with Controlling for Confounders

-   You can only control for variables that you actually think of
    controlling for.

-   If you control for too many variables, you may not have very many
    cases left in each category.

-   Post-treatment controls create bias.
