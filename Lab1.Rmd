# Problem 1: Choosing a Topic

What is a research topic that interests you, personally, enough to serve as a focus for your project this quarter? Identify a general topic area, and write a paragraph or two explaining why you are interested in it and how you see it as connected to political science.

# Problem 2: From Topic to Question

Now, I'd like you to brainstorm three different *causal* questions that:

- are part of your topic of interest, 

- meet the criteria for a viable question that we discussed in class, and 

- differ from each other as much as possible. 

After writing down your three questions, explain which one you think is best and why.

# Problem 3: Normative to Statistical

Below are three political topics that might come up in everyday conversation. How could these be turned into quantitative social science research questions? Provide a suggestion for each, and explain briefly what makes it a workable research question.

1. Why can't people show enough self-control to stop political corruption?

2. Whose fault is suburban sprawl?

3. How can we stop global warming?
