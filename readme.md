### Class Sessions

*Thursday, April 2nd: Finding Good Questions in Statistical Social Science*

Before class, read The Effect, Chapters 1-2.

Class activity: We will brainstorm a list of topics that social scientists study, and you will cluster yourselves into groups of 3-5 based on interest in specific topics. Then your job is to find a good quantitative research question connected to that topic. Each student will then send their TA an email describing that question and why they think it will work.
