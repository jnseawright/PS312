### The Four Questions

1.  Is there a relationship between $X$ and $Y$?

2.  Could $Y$ cause $X$?

3.  Is there a pathway linking $X$ and $Y$?

4.  Are there *confounding variables*?

### Controlling for Confounders

**Controlling for a confounder** is choosing a set of cases that all
have the same score on the confounding variable and looking at the
relationship between the IV and the DV in only those cases.

---
### Problems with Controlling for Confounders

-   You can only control for variables that you actually think of
    controlling for.

-   If you control for too many variables, you may not have very many
    cases left in each category.

-   Post-treatment controls create bias.
